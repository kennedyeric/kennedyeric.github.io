The CEMPPR Lab (Collaboration on Emergency Management, Policy, and Preparedness Research) is dedicated to improving how we prepare for, respond to, and manage emergencies. We emphasize action research, where our projects are driven by the needs of real-world practitioners and produce both new knowledge and tangible impacts for communities. We mentor and support a diverse community of trainees, and partner with students, academics, practitioners, and community members.
 
Current projects include systematic reviews on barriers to individual wildfire preparedness, empirical comparison between long-term wellness indicators of evacuees, and a meta-review of ethical issues in wildfire management. Lab members include both undergraduate and graduate students in the Disaster and Emergency Management program at York.
